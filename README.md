# Insertion Sort Analysis Script

This script creates an amount of lists of any size. Then it runs an insertion sort on them. It then outputs the inital list, the sorted list, total amount of iterations, complexity of the inital list, and time taken.
This script was made to find out what plays more a factor in the total iterations of the algorithm, the size of the list or the complexity of it.
In this script complexity is defined by the dot product of the inital list and the sorted list divided by the dot product of the sorted list and itself.

# TO RUN
Make sure that the script sits in a folder and above it there is a folder named data. Also the script only works on a UNIX machine.

$ python3 insertion_sort.py
is the run command
